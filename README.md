# UsefulCode
## A collection of code to assist in data munging and analysis. 

This repository is a sampling of what I've used, though it is not exhaustive. UsefulCode is an effort to preserve code I often use and adapt (in R, Python, SQL, and HANA) in both academia and industry contexts.  I will likely add to this repository as time goes on or as I get requests.  I have included both simple data munging scripts to full documented psychological experiments I have created.  All scripts have been created and curated by me alone unless otherwise specified.

Please feel free to read the Readmes in each folder, which detail the projects and techniques used. I have not included sample data files just yet, and I cannot include real ones due to non-disclosure agreements and the IRB. However, if you would like to practice with these, please let me know, and I'll see what I can throw together.  Happy landings!
