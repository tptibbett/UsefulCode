# UsefulCode
A collection of practice code to assist in data munging and analysis. 

I have spent a lot of time in R, Python, SQL, and HANA in both academic and industry.  This repository is a sampling of what I've used.Please feel free to read the Readmes in each folder, which detail the projects and techniques used. I have not included sample data files just yet, and I cannot include real ones due to non-disclosure agreements and the IRB. However, if you would like to practice with these, please let me know, and I'll see what I can throw together.  Happy landings!
