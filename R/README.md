# R Code
## Baltimore_Police_Crime_Geospatial.R
This code utilizes ggmap, stacking on ggplot2, to create a scatterplot overlay on a subset of geography.  I utilized years of monthly crime reports on a publically accessible database for Baltimore, MD, to find out just how much hand-to-hand combat goes on in Baltimore.  This code utilizes ggplot, ggmap, and various base R functions.  This code was driven by practice and curiosity.

## SEM_USElection.R
This code utilizes the lavaan library to do structural equation modeling.  The impetus was a US Presidential Election study and the emotional reactions and life satisfaction changes in a longitudinal study.  In the code, I create four SEM models and compare them. This code was driven by my academic projects in the Emotion Science Lab.

## Simple_Mediation_Indecision.R
This code utilizes the lavaan library to do simple mediation modeling.  The project involved work in the indecision literature, particularly focused on the psychological construct of regret.  The script also utilizes basic R functions like correlation matrices.  The script was driven by my academic collaboration with DePaul University.
